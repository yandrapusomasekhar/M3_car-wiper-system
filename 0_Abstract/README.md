###INTRODUCTION
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicle’s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. It is recommended that the system to have a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of distractions, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed.

Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. Because the manual adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents. This is review paper for automatic wiper in various method and also explain the basic skeleton for adjust speed of wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining.

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper

###OBJECTIVE
The aim of the project is to design a wiper control system which automatically controls the wiper according to the rain fall of water.In large cities and industries where supply and distribution tanks are at a largedistance from water control station, it is very difficult situation to monitor the water.

The main objective of this project is through ARM microcontroller to design a wiper control system. The project mainly insists on controlling the motion of wiper based on frequency and time period (in seconds).
